# yourls-notifier
Plugin for [Yourls](https://yourls.org/) sending notifications.

At the moment, this plugin only supports Discord and only send notifications when an url is shortened or clicked (configurable).

# How to install
Like most Yourls plugins, just download the [latest release](https://github.com/SosthenG/yourls-notifier/releases/latest) and drop the `notifier` folder in the `user/plugins` directory.

# How to use
Go to the plugin configuration page and set your Discord webhook url. If you don't have one, you need to create it first.

It's very simple, you can check Discord [official documentation](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks) if you don't know how.
